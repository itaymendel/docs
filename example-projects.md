We've created a few example projects that will help you learn how to use bit (don't forget to take a look at each project's `readme` file on [GitHub](github.com)).  

* A [React movie-app](https://github.com/teambit/movie-app) with UI components, and a [matching Collection](https://bitsrc.io/bit/movie-app) of components shared from this App with Bit.
* [Ramda with Bit](https://github.com/teambit/ramda), and a [matching collection](https://bitsrc.io/bit/ramda) of individual components from the library.
